# # IWDS Component Monitor
# # Monitors changes to specific files/folders and dispatches the information to

# #   - The trigger 'branches' must match the main/master naming. Update if 'master' is used instead of 'main'
# #   - The trigger 'paths' must match the expected location of the components to monitor
# #   - The 'path' value within the "Get changed files" step should match the trigger 'paths'
